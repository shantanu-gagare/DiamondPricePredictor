# Diamond Price Prediction

Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project! In this repository, we have developed a robust machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict diamond prices.

- Overview:
Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project! In this repository, we have developed a robust machine learning model using the Decision Tree Regressor algorithm to predict diamond prices.

- Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to accurately estimate the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and more.

- Dataset:
We have trained and evaluated our model using a comprehensive dataset containing information about thousands of diamonds, ensuring a diverse and representative sample.

- Key Features:

Machine Learning: Our model is built on the foundation of Decision Tree Regressors, a powerful tool in machine learning.
Data Preprocessing: We've invested significant effort in data preprocessing to ensure data quality, which directly impacts model accuracy.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is thoroughly assessed using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
- Model Accuracy:
Our Decision Tree Regressor model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 95%. This high accuracy signifies the model's capability to make reliable price predictions.
