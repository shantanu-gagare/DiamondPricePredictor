# Diamond Price Prediction

Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project! In this repository, we have developed a robust machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to predict diamond prices.

- Overview:

- Objective: The goal of this project is to accurately estimate the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and more.

- Dataset: We have trained and evaluated our model using a comprehensive dataset containing information about thousands of diamonds.

- Model Selection: After rigorous experimentation, we have chosen the Random Forest algorithm as our final model due to its exceptional performance in predicting diamond prices.

- Key Features:

- Machine Learning: We have implemented and fine-tuned a Random Forest regression model, leveraging the power of ensemble learning.

- Data Preprocessing: Our project includes thorough data preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and model accuracy.

- Model Evaluation: We have evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

- Usage:

You can use our trained model to predict diamond prices for your own dataset or individual diamonds.

We have provided a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to load the model and make predictions.
